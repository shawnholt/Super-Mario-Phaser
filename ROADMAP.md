# Project Roadmap & Quest Log

## Quick Wins (10–20 mins)
Small, visual, or sound tweaks to warm up.
- [ ] Visual: Change the sky color or tint to set a new vibe.
- [ ] Audio: Swap the jump sound effect for something funnier.
- [ ] HUD: Adjust score/time text size or position so it reads clearly on smaller screens.
- [ ] Controls hint: Add a tiny “A/D or Arrows to move, Space to jump” note on the start screen.

## Medium Quests (about 1 hour)
Takes a bit of logic but still bite-sized.
- [ ] Physics: Make coins pop out, fall, and bounce once before disappearing instead of hovering.
- [ ] Mechanics: Add a Double Jump (maybe only when grown/fire to keep balance).
- [ ] Enemies: Make Goombas speed up after a timer or when the player reaches mid-level.

## Boss Level Projects (multi-session)
Big changes that need planning.
- [ ] Avatar swap: Press `C` to swap Mario for another character sprite set.
- [ ] Level editor: Place blocks by hand instead of purely random generation.
- [ ] Mobile polish: Add on-screen jump/fire buttons alongside the joystick.

## The Icebox (ideas for later)
- Multiplayer run-and-race mode.
- Power-up that makes Mario invisible (sneak past enemies?).
